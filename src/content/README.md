# Content

Data-first, designer-owned content: maps, scenarios, prefabs, cutscenes, resource sets.

## Hard Rule

- **No logic here. Only data, scenes, and resources.**

## Rules

- Scripts in `content/` are forbidden unless they are editor-only helpers (then they belong in `addons/` or `tools/`).
- Content scenes compose feature/shared components without embedding game rules.
